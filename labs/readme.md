# Labs

In this labs you will create a Food App. Food App is a food delivery application that is used to demonstrate how to combine the different Azure building blocks, in order to build a modern cloud native application. It consists of several Micro Frontends and uses a Microservice Architecture which will be hosted on Azure Container Apps to allow focusing on the development of the application and not on the infrastructure. 

Dapr will be used to connect the different microservices and to implement the Saga Pattern to handle distributed transactions. It will also provide Service Discovery, Observability and Distributed Tracing.
