The **Saga pattern** is a design pattern used to manage data consistency across microservices in distributed transaction scenarios¹. It consists of a sequence of transactions that update each service and trigger the next transaction step by publishing a message or event¹. If a step fails, the saga executes compensating transactions that counteract the preceding transactions¹.

The Saga pattern is commonly used in scenarios where cross-service data consistency is required, but traditional distributed transaction protocols like the two-phase commit (2PC) are not feasible¹. It provides transaction management using a series of local transactions, where each local transaction updates the database and publishes a message or event to trigger the next local transaction¹. If a local transaction fails, the saga executes a series of compensating transactions to undo the changes made by the preceding local transactions¹.
