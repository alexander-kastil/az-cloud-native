# Designing & Implementing Cloud Native Applications using Microsoft Azure

The seminar is aimed at Azure developers and software architects who want an overview of the core elements and tools for developing and deploying cloud-native applications in Microsoft Azure. It also prepares for the following Applied Skills:

- Deploy cloud-native apps using Azure Container Apps (AZ-2003)
- Build distributed apps with .NET Aspire ()

Alongside the theoretical parts of the individual modules, we will modernize an app from a classic monolith to a cloud-native app with microservices and the associated micro-frontends. In doing so, we will discuss the Cloud Maturity Model and emphasize the use of best practices and cloud design patterns. We will also introduce you to the .NET Aspire Framework, which we will partially use for the implementation of the microservices.

We will cover container essentials and concepts such as configuration management, stateful containers, and the sidecar pattern. To ensure a developer-centric focus, we will distribute on Kubernetes-based Azure Container Apps and cover topics such as secrets, revisions, config injection, health checks, Kubernetes Event Driven Auto-Scaling (KEDA), stateful containers, and jobs. For the authentication of service-to-service communication, we use managed identities and service connectors. The knowledge gained here can also be applied to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure Red Hat OpenShift.

We use Azure Functions to implement microservices, which can be hosted either serverless or as containers. Specifically, we will cover topics such as durable functions and entities, their use cases, and monitoring.

We will discuss the advantages of NoSQL databases and guide you from relational DB design to Cosmos DB NoSQL data and event stores, considering Domain Driven Design (DDD). We will cover topics such as data modeling, partitioning and performance optimization, CRUD with SDKs and Data API Builder, change feed, materialized views, event sourcing, and CQRS.

We will teach the basics of event-driven applications, message flow design, orchestration, and saga. In the chapter on Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr), we will cover topics such as service invocation, state management, secrets, configuration, bindings, pub/sub, Dapr actors, observability, and distributed tracing, alongside developer environment setup and debugging.

We will publish, secure, and optimize our cloud-native app and its microservices with API Management and Application Gateway, and discuss topics such as revision and versions, authentication, and implementing a backends for frontend pattern (BFF) using GraphQL.

Last but not least, we will connect our micro frontends using Azure Event Grid to implement real-time connected order status and production dashboards.

The demos, lab starters, and solutions will mostly be provided in .NET and Angular. Occasionally, alternative technology stacks may be used or referenced in their documentation.

Prerequisites and Target Audience
Course participants who want to successfully complete the labs should have practical experience with the knowledge imparted in the AZ-204 seminar. DevSecOps relevant topics are covered in a separate course.
