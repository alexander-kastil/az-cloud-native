# Using Integration Events to pass data between Microservices using Service Bus

In this demo we are using Integration Events to pass data between two services. 

- Order Service was implemented using the webapi template
- Payment Service is an Azure Function

>Note: As we are going to use Dapr Pub/Sub to pass data between microservices in our next module, we are not going into details of how to write Subscriptions and Handlers using Integration Events.
